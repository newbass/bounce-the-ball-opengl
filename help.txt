Game Name: Bounce-The-Ball

This game was built inspired by the vintage 'pacman' game,
enhanced by theme and creativity.
There are two levels in the game, played solely on keyboard
controls.

=====================================================

 Basic Controls:

Left-arrow key: Ball moves left
Right-arrow key: Ball moves right
Down-arrow key: Convert to trampoline
	--> In each level, the player will get a chance to
	    convert a(only one) block into trampoline when the
	    ball lands on it.
Up-arrow key: Ball jumps up
	--> This control helps the ball to jump up when it is
	    on ground(level 1) or cloud(level 2).
ESC: To quit the game midway. (Though we prefer, you don't!) 

=====================================================

 Elements:

Ground: The green patch where the journey of the ball begins in
	in level 1 is the ground. The player can take off the
	in the air using the "jump" control.

Water:  The blue patch in the center of the ground is a water
	body which influences the movement of the ball as per
	the laws of physics. *Try it out to know more.

Blocks: These are the scoring blocks shown in purple-black 
	color. When you land on it for the first time, the 
	score is incremented by 10 and the color turns yellow
	to let the player know how far has he gone in the game.
   *Note: These blocks sway in the air, in level 2. Well, 
that's the theme. Cross the first level to learn more.

Trampoline: In each level, the player will get a chance to
	convert the block into a trampoline. Have a look
	at the controls to know how to convert. From the next 
	drops on the trampoline, the ball will jump higher than
	the normal block. The color of the block is changed to
	purple-blue.

Cloud:  In level 2, the ground which served as the base of the
	game is now replaced by a level higher, i.e. the 
	clouds.

Porcupine: The ugly looking beast making rounds on the cloud,
	is the death of the player. Touch it, in case you get
	bored.

Snow:	The flying balls that appear floating from left to
	right in level 2 are the snow ball which on colliding
	with the ball fetches 5 points.

==========================================================

 Understanding the game:

=> In level 1, you have to land on each of the 10 blocks to procede
 to level 2. 
   You may need the trampoline.
   Use the control carefully.
   Once you used a trampoline, the controls can't be reset.
   After you have fetched 100 points in level 1, find out how to reach
 the sky to get to level 2.

=> In level 2, the difficulties have increased. 
   You have proved your mettle. Now, time to prove your temperament. 
   Fetch 250 points, here it isn't required that you land on all the balls. 
   Snow balls can help you ticking with the scoreboard. 
   Beware of the porcupine on the cloud. One touch, and the game ends. 
   The blocks sway in a uniform direction initially. When you lands on a 
 block, it randomly waits and moves.
   There may be collisions among the blocks.
   Also, due to heavy storm,
 the ball is constanly moving to the right. Look at the effects, when you
 move left or right while playing.
   Fetch as many points as you can, and
 end the game as you levelled up in level 1. Try reaching for the stars.

===========================================================

HAPPY GAMING!!
